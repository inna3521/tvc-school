      <P>A web page is a document in the same way that a Google Doc is a document and a Microsoft Word document is as well. What does it mean to be a document? Here is the dictionary definition:</P>
      <P><b>Document:</b> A piece of written, printed or electronic matter that provides information or evidence or that serves as an official record.</P>
      <P>Web pages fit that definition quite well! According to Wikipedia a <b>web page</b> is a <em>document</em> that is suitable for the World Wide Web and web browsers.</P>
      <P>In this lesson we are going to look at a Goole Doc as a way of learning about electronic documents.</P>
